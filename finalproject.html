	<h2>Final Project Explanation</h2>
		
<p>
	My final project, Facts You Probably Don’t Know, is an educational app inspired by past assignments. The application uses various coding techniques 
	and methods such as loops, arrays, global and local variables, and conditionals, fortunately, it does not stop there. I also implemented Khan Academy’s 
	button class throughout my program, without the buttons the program might as not exist, which makes the Khan Button class both very useful and important 
	to my program. Using the application itself is very simple and does not cause a lot of headache programming and playing.
</p>

<p>
	First, you start with the splash screen which contains one button that changes the screen to the instruction screen. The instruction screen shows text which 
	is held in an array to simplify code and a single “next” button that is shown throughout the rest of the program. The next 3 screens are the questions that 
	will be asked and for each question, you are presented with 3 options, only one of the options is correct if you answer incorrectly there will be a “try again”
	button ready to clear your mistake and answer again. After answering the final question there will be an end program that will take you back to the splash 
	screen so you can do it all over again!
